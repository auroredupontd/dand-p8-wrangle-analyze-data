    "[WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs) is a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It was launched in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media coverage for its popularity.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This account allows people to send photos of their dog, then tweets selected photos rating and a humorous comment. Dogs are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings in excess of the maximum, such as \"13/10\". Popular posts are re-posted on Instagram and Facebook. \n",
    "Besides, the account's language has spawned an Internet language about \"doggos\" and \"puppers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2017, the Twitter account had nearly 3.75 million followers. As of July 2018, 7.08 million followers."
